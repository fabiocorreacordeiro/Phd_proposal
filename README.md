## Introduction  
  
The automobile was the symbol of the industrial age. Ford’s assembly line shaped the twentieth-century industry, cities, and society. In the same way, the self-driving car is the symbol of the digital transformation. A self-driving car is a physical object, however, besides its mechanical and electrical components, it is powered by many software and artificial intelligence algorithms. Furthermore, communication protocols allow the exchange of information with other cars, the road, traffic signals, satellites, the internet as well as other existing systems.  
  
However, what makes it possible for a car to drive itself is data, a lot of data. A self-driving car has much more sensors than an ordinary car. The sensors receive information about engine rotation, velocity, fuel level, and brake temperature. There are several cameras and 3D scannings that interpret images of other vehicles, pedestrians and traffic signals. They access information about localization from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, update maps and routes from the internet, as well as information from social networks.   
  
The same phenomenon that is happening with ordinary cars is happening or will happen with almost all equipment and machines. The concept that all systems consist of two systems, one physical and the other virtual, is called digital twins (Grieve, 2017). Digital twins are data-intensive systems, so it is very important to pay special attention to unstructured data. Some studies estimate that they are about 80% of all generated data (Chelmis et al., 2013).   
  
For a long time, companies have made a big effort to integrate their structured data. However, unstructured data is still being underused. For that reason, this Ph.D. proposal is about how to use unstructured data in a digital twin for an oil and gas field. More specifically, how to ingest and process this data to use in the models that will support this digital twin.  
  
First of all, it is necessary to understand what digital technology is and the difference between the physical and virtual layers in its architecture. Another important aspect is the definition of complex and cognitive systems and digital twins.  
  
This proposal is for a specific kind of digital twin, a digital oil field. The components of an oil field are the geological reservoir, the wells, submarine equipment, pipes and risers where the oil flows from the reservoir to the surface and the topside equipment in the oil platform. There are many sources of data and sensors in this complex system. All this data has the potential to increase the precision and reliability of the digital twin. For this reason, the purpose of this proposal is to understand how to process unstructured and semi-structured data for the ingestion of a digital oil field.
